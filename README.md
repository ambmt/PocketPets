# PocketPets

## Commands & Permissions
- /pets givepet <Player> <Pet> - Gives the specified pet to the specified player. (pets.givepet)

- /pets reload - Reloads the plugin's config. (pets.reload)

- /pets help - Displays the command list. (pets.help)

## Customizing

- You can configure the skin heads in the config, I tested a few skins and they worked,
  although I couldn't find a skin for most of the pets, you just need to put the username in 
  the config file in its corresponding section (Each pet has a config section).

- You can also configure the amount of EXP the pets gain every X seconds (Also configurable)

## Contributing

- You can contribute however you want, I am not planning on committing too much to this repo.
